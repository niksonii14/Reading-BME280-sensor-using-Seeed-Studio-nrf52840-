Step-1:  
download seeed studio board in Arduino IDE by pasting this link into "additional board manager url" section or Arduino IDE

                     https://files.seeedstudio.com/arduino/package_seeeduino_boards_index.json

Step-2:
Search for "seeed nrf52" or "nrf52" in Board manager section in Arduino IDE and download and install it.

Step-3:
Install  following libraries from LIBRARY manager section in Arduino IDE.
"Wire.h" ,  "Adafruit_Sensor.h"  ,  "Adafruit_BME280.h"  ,  "bluefruit.h" 


FOR HARDWARE connection, Connect "SDA", "SCL", "3V3" and "GND" pins of BME280 sensor to the "SDA", "SCL", "3V3" and "GND" pins of Seeed studio nrf52840 board.

      "SDA" pin of BME280 sensor <-------> "SDA" pin of Seeed studio nrf52840 board
      "SCL" pin of BME280 sensor <-------> "SCL" pin of Seeed studio nrf52840 board
      "GND" pin of BME280 sensor <-------> "GND" pin of Seeed studio nrf52840 board
      "3V3" pin of BME280 sensor <-------> "3V3" pin of Seeed studio nrf52840 board

now connect hardware to the PC/Laptop and paste the code in Arduino IDE.
